  <p>This prayer sends an extraplanar creature back to its own plane of existence. The caster rolls a power-check, using wisdom, to set the DC for the target's saving throw vs will. If the save is failed, the target is banished.</p>
  <p>A banished target must roll a save vs fortitude, DC 12, or die on arrival on its home plane. The caster has no control over where the target arrives in his home realm. No more than one attempt can be made on the same target in the same game session.</p>

  <p>This prayer works only on normal, nonmagical targets. An awakened creature rolls 3d6 for intelligence and charisma. It is friendly to the caster, but the caster has no control over it. It can speak one language known by the caster.</p>
  <p>An awakened tree has 30 hp, an AC of 18, and a damage reduction of 20 vs piercing and blunt attacks. It has one attack per round with a +8 to hit, for 3d6 blunt damage. It has a reach of 5 meters, and can move only slowly (maybe half the speed of a walking human). It gains senses similar to a human's.</p>
  <p>An awakened animal gains 5 extra hit points, and a +2 to hit. The DM has statistics for animals.</p>

  <p>This prayer makes one species of animal hate the target. When he comes within 20 meters of an animal from that species, the animal will make warning signals (bark, growl, etc). Further reactions depend on the animal's nature, but they are usually fight or flight.</p>
  <p>Domesticated animals can be restrained, but they show obvious distress and may attack at any provocation. Mounts will try to throw off their rider, forcing a riding-check -4 every round. Animals extremely loyal to the target, such as an animal influenced by the animal friendship prayer, do not become utterly hostile to their owner. Instead, they notice something "wrong" about the target and act unusually nervous, resulting in a -6 modifier to the target's appropriate skill-check (riding, charioteering or animal handling).</p>

  <p>This prayer breaks the target's mind. He becomes unsure of himself and extremely sensitive to mental influences.</p>
  <p>This translates in a -4 to hit and damage, to saves vs will, and to the DC of saving throws for any abilities he uses. If the caster is within medium range, all these penalties double.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the caster can order the character to do as he wants, every round as a bonus action. This takes place at the end of the round, forcing the target to make a saving throw vs will DC 15 or follow the caster's commands for the next round.</p>

  <p>Additionally, and at a price, the target can boost himself beyond his normal capabilities, gaining a +6 to strength or dexterity. This is decided when declaring intentions, it starts at the round's beginning and lasts the whole round. The target can boost both abilities at the same time.</p>
  <p>At the end of the prayer, the target must roll a saving throw vs fortitude. The DC starts at 0, and is raised by 5 for every time the target boosted an ability. If two abilities were boosted in the same round, the DC is raised by 8. If the save is failed, then the target loses 1 point in both abilities permanently. This ability damage does not regenerate, and cannot be healed by restoration prayers.</p>

  <p>Activating or deactivating the staff is an action with a speed of 3, which requires the touch of the caster. The tree can make its first attack at the end of the round in which it is activated.</p>
  <p>An animated tree has two attacks per round, at a +8 to hit. Its first attack is at the same initiative as the caster, its second is at the end of the round. Its hits deal 4d8 blunt damage.</p>
  <p>The tree's AC is 18, and it has 5 points of damage reduction against every type of damage except fire and lightning. It saves vs fortitude at +7, vs reflex at +3 and vs will at +5, but is immune to mind-affecting magic. It has 50 hit points.</p>
  <p>The staff can be animated for 2 hours, at which point it reverts back to a staff. It takes the staff 24 hours to regenerate any damage it has sustained. If the tree is reduced to 0 hit points, it and the staff are destroyed. The caster can own only one such enchanted staff at a time.</p>

  <p>This prayer curses the target to place everything he encounters into perfect order. While his abilities are not changed, his overwhelming desire for order impairs his usefulness.</p>
  <p>As a rule of thumb, assume that everything the character does takes ten times as long as it would another person. This also applies to actions of other characters; a character checking a door for traps will take ten times as long because the target is cleaning the door, making small repairs, straightening clothes, etc. This applies to everything the target does.</p>
  <p>When the target attempts to undertake a new action, such as attacking a monster, he must rationalise this action on the basis of his quest for order. If he cannot conceive a rationale, then he must delay his action for 1d4 rounds preparing. Once stated a rationale or plan, the target must follow through. Deviation is not acceptable.</p>
  <p>The target may become violent if he is prevented from being neat. He will do what he must to make the world around him more orderly. If he is allowed to organize his surroundings, he will quickly calm down again.</p>

  <tr><td>1d8</td><td>action</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>wander away from the area</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>do nothing but defend</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>stand motionless as if stunned</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>speak or make noises</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>drop anything held</td></tr>
  <tr><td>6</td><td>attack self (only misses on a 1)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7-8</td><td>attack nearest being</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>Actions are checked at the beginning of each round, after all other intentions have been decided.. The prayer has no fixed duration, it lasts until the last target leaves the area.</p>

  <p>This prayer teaches the caster how one recent event fits into the "grand scheme". He learns whether or not the event was coincidental, if it was aimed directly at the characters, if they somehow caused it, and if it will continue. The new knowledge is always true.</p>
  <p>This prayer requires some careful judgement from the DM. It does not divulge any specific facts, but should help the players determine what is going on. Many campaigns have several simultaneous storylines, so the DM may not have a grand scheme, and he may want to avoid railroading the players. When in doubt, at least answer the four questions in the first part of the prayer description.</p>
  <p>Casting this prayer "taints" subsequent castings of the same prayer. It takes a week for the taint to fade. If a second caster casts the prayer during this time, he receives an accurate reading.</p>

  <p>This prayer creates a huge carpet of biting and stinging vermin that kill everything in the area and consume any corpses and vegetation. The caster can then command the swarm to move to another location, at a speed of 20 meters per round. The swarm rolls its own initiative, and has a speed of 5. Directing the swarm can be done as a free action at the end of the round.</p>
  <p>Each of the vermin inflicts only 1 hp damage when it bites, but their numbers are so vast that damage reduction is useless. Armour and protective magic are simply overrun and invaded. Area damage to the swarm may kill substantial numbers, but more vermin arrive. Dispelling magic doesn't destroy the swarm, merely the caster's control over it.</p>
  <p>A character who makes his saving throw escapes from the area.</p>

  <p>This prayer infuses the target with holy purpose through a sacred connection with the caster. The target gains a +5 bonus to attacks, damage, AC, and saving throws. He takes only half damage from area effects, and suffers no effects from any failed saving throws.</p>
  <p>However, the caster also takes half damage from area effects affecting the target (in addition to his 'own' damage). Furthermore, all effects from the target's failed saving throws are applied to the caster.</p>
  <p>This prayer ends if the caster drops below 0 hit points, or by an action with a speed of 3 equivalent to spellcasting.</p>

  <p>This prayer causes the target's weapon skills to become dormant. They don't disappear, but the target can't use them anymore. The target remembers having the skills, but he can't replicate his former knowledge.</p>
  <p>Weapon skills are those that teach the use of a weapon, or that give a bonus to weapon use. Skills where the body is used as a weapon are included, but tumbling is not, for it grants a bonus to defense and not attack.</p>
  <p>If the saving throw is failed and its result is less than the caster level, then the duration of the curse becomes permanent.</p>
  <p>If the target gains levels with this curse, he can learn new weapon skills, but somehow he can't focus on those he should already know.</p>
  <p>This prayer is treated as a curse.</p>

  <p>This prayer allows the caster to transfer some of his memorized prayers, and the ability to cast them, to the target. Only non-magicusers can receive this gift (warlock powers are considered magic).</p>
  <p>The caster decides which prayers to grant, but there is a maximum amount of prayers depending on the target's level. He may decide to grant less. The prayers' characteristics (range, duration, etc) function according to the level of the original caster at the time of casting the delegate.

  <p>The caster merely senses evil intent. Only truly evil creatures are automatically revealed with this prayer. A cursed object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap will not.

  <p>This prayer allows the caster to sense magic emanations within 30 yards. It detects magic items, and dweomers that are in effect. If the DM permits, this prayer can also detect the remnants of spells that have already ended. This requires an observation-check with a -2 penalty for every turn that has passed.</p>
  <p>If a dweomer has been detected, the caster can try to learn more about it. This takes one round, and requires a spellcraft-check. On a successful check, he learns the strength of the dweomer compared to his own caster level (stronger, comparable or weaker). He may also determine the sphere, if any, of the effect.</p>
  <p>This prayer never detects any form of invisibility magic or magic that enhances stealth. The focus is the caster's holy symbol.</p>

  <p>Discharging the prayer is an action with a speed of 3 and range: short. The caster rolls a power-check using his priest level and his [wis].

  <p>This prayer attempts to negate magical effects. It can be cast at either an area or a single effect. In either case, the caster rolls a power-check, using his priest level and [wis].</p>
  <p>If cast at an area, the DC to dispel an effect is 15 + its circle. The circle of a warlock power is the result of the power-check divided by 10.</p>
  <p>Only active effects are affected. If magic is being cast at the moment of dispelling (all magic that happens at a later initiative count), it is automatically dispelled. Magic items are not affected by this use of the spell.</p>
  <p>If cast at a single effect that is not a curse, the target DC is 10 + the effect's circle + the caster's relevant ability modifier.</p>
  <p>If the target effect is a curse, the DC is the curse's DC + 10 (as explained under exorcism on page 40), or 25, whichever is higher. Failure to remove a curse raises the DC by 5.</p>
  <p>The caster can always dispel his own magic, even if it is a curse.</p>
  <p>Magic items are hard to dispel completely. Unless the caster's power-check exceeds the item DC by 10, the item will eventually regain its magic. Dispel magic attempts inside an active volcano gain a +12 circumstance modifier to the power-check.</p>

  <p>The devil has 9 hp, AC 16, +2 to hit and can move 60 meters every round. It can attack once per round, for 1d4 hp cold damage, with a speed of 1. It can put out torches, lanterns and small campfires in a single round.</p>
  <p>The creature can also create a dust cloud with a 2 meter radius. This takes it one round to accomplish. Creatures within the cloud can see only one meter ahead, and spellcasters must make a saving throw vs fortitude DC 12 to keep their concentration when casting spells. Unless maintained by the air devil, the dust cloud dissipates after one round.</p>

  <p>Creatures in an earthquake must save vs reflex, with a +4 bonus, or die as the ground opens up beneath them. Creatures that are larger than humans or that have more than 2 legs gain an additional +5 bonus to this roll. Trees, having a lousy reflex save, still gain a +8 from their size.</p>
  <p>Structures, having no reflex save, must roll 15 or higher on a d20 to survive (more or less) intact. Buildings with strong foundations may get a bonus, but never more than a +8 for buildings built on bedrock. The exact effect here must be up to the DM.</p>

  <p>This prayer protects an area against fire. Normal fires cannot burn there, and are extinguished upon the casting of the prayer. Magical fires cause only half of their normal damage. Additionally, creatures within the area of effect receive a +4 bonus to saving throws made vs fire attacks, regardless of whether the attacks originated inside or outside the warded area. The prayer has no direct effects on fire-based creatures in the area, but they must make a saving throw vs fortitude DC 14 to enter the warded area.</p>

  <p>This prayer wards a chosen object that can be opened and closed, such as a door, chest or locket. The target item cannot have a second closure or warding enchantment placed upon it. If the item opens, the prayer discharges. The caster can designate a keyword that disables the prayer for 1 round.</p>
  <p>Upon discharge, there is an explosion with a 2 meter radius, causing 1d4 + 1 / level hit points heat damage. The item trapped is not harmed by this explosion. If used underwater, the prayer creates a large cloud of steam and inflicts half damage.</p>
  <p>The prayer is hard to spot, inflicting a -6 penalty to the observation-check. Failure to remove it triggers the detonation.</p>

  <p>This prayer guards the area against unauthorised entry. The caster sets the conditions that set it off, and the effect. Any creature not authorised by the conditions sets off the effect.</p>
  <p>The conditions are limited to race, sex, size category or an obvious visible clue such as wearing a holy symbol or the direction the creature is coming from. It is also possible to set a password. These conditions do not stack.</p>
  <p>The effect can be 1d4 / level cold, fire, lightning or sonic (but not acid) damage, or the effect of a prayer. Possible prayers are: beastspite (specify in advance), cause disease, curse of blindness, curse of peace, faerie fire, feign death, hesitation, hold animal, hold person, random action, random causality, rigid thinking, silence or sunscorch. The DM may allow other prayers. If the caster wants to include another prayer, he must have it prepared and cast it with the glyph. This is included in the casting time.</p>
  <p>The target receives a saving throw to avoid the glyph's effect, but no other die roll to avoid a prayer effect, even if the prayer description grants one. If the glyph inflicts instantaneous damage, then the save halves; in all other cases, the save negates.</p>
  <p>Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded.</p>
  <p>The area is visible as warded, as a glyph on the ground or item, but in darkness or torchlight an observation-check without penalty is needed to spot it. It can be removed by a lockpicking-check with a penalty equal to the caster level. A spellcraft-check with a penalty equal to the caster level can determine the type of glyph.</p>

  <p>This prayer heats a metal object. For purposes of this prayer, a suit of metal armour counts as one object. It is also often cast on a smaller object such as a necklace, or on a weapon. It also works on creatures made of metal, who are affected as if they were a suit of armour.</p>
  <p>An affected suit of armour starts doing damage on the round following the casting. It inflicts 1d4 points of fire damage, just before the action of the character wearing the armour. On the following 5 rounds, it inflicts 2d4 points of damage, and on the last round it once again inflicts 1d4 damage.</p>
  <p>A smaller worn item such as a necklace also starts inflicting damage the round following the casting. It inflicts 1d4 damage for 7 rounds. If the object is held, such as a sword, it can be easily dropped, but a worn item requires a dex-check to remove. This action causes 2d4 damage whether or not it succeeds.</p>
  <p>Heated weapons cause 1 extra point of heat damage. Weapons with wooden handles don't inflict fire damage to the wielder, but if a natural 1 is rolled to hit, the shaft cracks and the weapon becomes improvised.</p>

  <p>This prayer creates holy ground. If it is cast without a source of devotional energy present, it fails.

Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two worshippers, while priests (of any level) count as ten.</p>
  <p>Holy ground grants advantages for followers of the deity of the caster. They gain a +1 to hit and to all saving throws, and 1 point of damage reduction. Also, they gain a +1 to any power-checks made for the banishment and exorcism skills. Power-checks to scry into the area have their DC raised by 10, and attempts to animate dead automatically fail unless they are made by a caster of the same faith as the caster of the holy ground prayer.</p>
  <p>The holy ground can also accommodate an additional effect. This effect must be a prayer of 3rd circle or less that the caster has access to, and is limited to the following prayers: accelerate healing, aura of comfort, circle of privacy, curse of peace, ethereal barrier, faerie fire, hideaway, invisibility purge, invisibility to animals, invisibility to undead, light, obscurement, pass without trace, plant growth, prayer, silence, slow poison, speak with animals, water breathing, water walk and zone of truth.</p>

  <p>This prayer allows the caster to ignore the needs of his body. He requires no food or drink and gains 2 points of damage reduction vs heat, cold and lightning damage. He can also ignore the need to sleep by choosing to meditate instead. While meditating, the caster can keep watch on his surroundings, but he suffers a -4 penalty to any alertness checks.</p>
  <p>When the prayer ends, the caster must eat a meal or he must make a constitution check every hour to avoid falling into a coma. He then loses 1d4 points of constitution every morning until a healing-check is made with a penalty equal to the number of days of the vigil and he consumes his meal.</p>
  <p>The caster also requires at least four hours of rest for each day that he did not eat, drink, or sleep during his vigil. He cannot use this prayer again until he is rested.</p>

  <p>This prayer attempts to shield the target from changes in his life force. This is defined as level or ability draining (other than by poison) or the application of curses. If such a change is attempted, the target receives a +10 to his saving throw. If the effect does not grant a saving throw, the character receives a saving throw vs fortitude with a DC of 20. This prayer only wards against the first attack.</p>
  <p>This prayer prevents the character from gaining levels and from becoming pregnant. It ends immediately if the target attempts to change the life force of another creature (other than by "normal" killing).</p>

  This prayer changes the last hour of the target's memory. The caster decides what the new memory will be. However, the prayer does not allow the caster to read the target's memory, so it is always partly guesswork.
  The DM assigns a modifier to the new memory, from -8 to +8. This modifier is applied to the target's saving throw. If the DM decides that the new memory is simply too illogical, then the target keeps his memory.
  Whatever the target remembers, this prayer cannot negate magic effects. It is a curse.

  <p>This prayer causes the next magic cast by the target to be chosen randomly from his prepared spells or prayers from the same circle or lower, or from his warlock powers. It has no effect on a character without spellcasting abilities (but the caster does not learn this). If the target has multiple magic-using classes, only magic from the same class is randomly chosen.</p>
  <p>When the target casts his next magic, he doesn't learn of the miscast magic until it takes effect. The miscast magic functions normally; it fades from the target's memory and its material components fade from the target's possessions (in addition to the components for the intended magic). The miscast magic still needs to conform to its maximum range and area; this might cause it to fizzle harmlessly. The target retains the capability to cast the intended magic.</p>

  <p>This prayer affects the growth of plants. Its effects depend on the target area.</p>
  <p>If it is cast on a single plant, the caster can alter the age of a plant by up to 5 years per caster level. This change can be forward or backward. It changes the size of a plant, but it does not generate seeds or flowers out of season. If the plant is a monstrous or magical plant, the prayer causes a +4 or -4 to hit, and changes the target's damage die to the next higher or lower die. To the target, this prayer counts as a curse.</p>
  <p>If the prayer is cast on an area with a radius of 5 meters, it transforms the available plant life into a barrier that acts like an 'entangle' prayer, trapping anything in the area.</p>
  <p>The last use for this prayer is in conjunction with the 'holy ground' prayer. In this version, the prayer enhances the yields of the harvests within 5 kilometers from the holy ground. This does not prevent disasters such as floods or droughts, but even in these cases the plants survive better than expected. This effect always ends in the midst of winter, whenever the prayer has been cast.</p>

  <p>This prayer provides the caster with a sixth sense for danger. He receives a mental warning when he contemplates actions that may bring physical harm during the spell duration. For example, a character about to open a trapped chest would experience a gut feeling telling him not to do so, but a character threatening someone who will get even with the caster in an hour wouldn't. This translates in a +8 bonus to saving throws vs traps. He does not get a free warning just by contemplating actions.</p>
  <p>In combat, this prayer grants a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws, as long as the caster ducks, dodges, or withdraws when his subconscious tells him to. However, in any given round there is a 1 in 4 chance that he will have to forego his intended action in order to obey the spell's warning impulses.</p>
  <p>The prayer only works on actions undertaken by the caster himself. If his companion is about to pull a mysterious lever that will drop a 10-ton block of stone, there is no warning.</p>

  <p>This prayer allows the targets to benefit from each other's experiences. All skills known by any of the targets grant a +4 bonus to the skill-check for the other recipients. To power-checks it grants a +2.</p>
  <p>This bonus is cumulative, so that 3 people who have the stealth skill each gain a +8 bonus. Targets of this spell are unable to hide their skills from the others. This prayer doesn't allow targets to use new warlock powers, but they get a bonus if they already know them.</p>

  <p>This prayer allows the caster to see faraway places, objects or creatures in a pool of water. This requires a power-check using [wis]. The start DC for this check is 10 to scry a place, 15 for an object, character level for a creature and hit points divided by 5 for a monster. If the caster has seen the target in person, the DC is lowered by 5. Magic that protects from scrying raises the DC.</p>
  <p>If successful, the caster sees an area with a radius of 10 meters. He can zoom in and out to some degree, but never through solid matter.</p>
  <p>The scrying can extend to all known realities. However, the DC for a target in another plane is increased by 5.</p>
  <p>No magic can be cast through this prayer, but enhancement magic that improves the caster's powers of perception functions normally. Infravision likewise operates normally. The image is not clear enough to read script.</p>

  <p>This prayer brings the target back from death, in a new body that appears in 1d6 turns. It won't work on targets that have been dead for more than a week, or that died of old age.</p>
  <p>The new form is determined semi-randomly, by rolling on the following table. Normally, the target rolls 1d12, but the DM can choose to have a different roll. If the target has bad karma, or the caster's deity doesn't like him, roll 1d8. If he has good karma or the deity likes him, then roll 1d8+4.<ol>

  <p>In being revived, the target loses the last level he gained. His new body is a young adult, so any age modifiers are removed. Bonus ability points gained from every fourth level are also deleted. The target does recall most of his former life, though he may be fuzzy on the details for the first few days.</p>

  <p>Lightweight or flying creatures escape the prayer automatically.</p>
  <p>The prayer is automatically reversed by a dispel magic cast within 1 turn, but it does not restore the shape of former rock. Mud created by this prayer turns to normal dirt in a day.</p>

  <p>This prayer is an attempt to befriend an animal. At the beginning of the casting, the animal rolls a saving throw. If it fails, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about.</p>
  <p>Only a normal animal can be enspelled, and only one animal can be attracted at a time. If another animal is attracted, the currently befriended animal leaves. Furthermore, the prayer functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal senses them. If the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state.</p>
  <p>If the caster has the animal training skill, he gains a +4 bonus to the skill-check to train the befriended animal. Furthermore, he can teach it one additional trick. This trick is lost if the trainer leaves the animal.</p>
  <p>If the character's player uses this prayer with ulterior motives without admitting it, his character will never again be able to cast this prayer, or research another one in its place.</p>

  <p>This prayer creates a trap from any supple vine or rope. This snare blends with the surroundings, imparting a -10 penalty to any observation-check to find it.</p>
  <p>If a creature moves into the area, the snare tightens around him and tightly binds him. This inflicts 1d6 hp damage. If a tree is nearby (within 5 meters), the snare can be fastened to it so that it lifts the bound victim 3 meters into the air. The prayer does not react to creatures smaller than a dog.</p>
  <p>Escaping the area requires a rope use-check with a -6 penalty, as the snare continues to bind the target. Every attempt to escape takes about half an hour, and even if failed, grants a +2 bonus to the next one. However, every attempt also causes one point of strength and constitution damage. If another creature helps the target escape, he is freed in 3 rounds.</p>

  <p>The caster gains one thought object per casting of the spell. The spell may be cast a number of times in the same locale, but he will gain a different thought object each time. A locale contains a finite number of thoughts, however.</p>

  <p>This prayer infuses the targets with the powers of a totem. The caster chooses the totem, which is the same for all targets.</p>
  <p>bear: the targets grow 20 cm in size, gaining 5 points of both strength and constitution.</p>
  <p>horse: the targets can run rapidly, doubling their speed, and they gain the endurance skill.</p>
  <p>wolf: the targets gain the tracking skill, with every additional target granting a +4 to the skill-check. If one of the targets already knew the skill, all targets, including himself, grant a +4 to his skill-check.</p>
  <p>rat: the targets shrink to the size of rats, able to swim and burrow. They gain a +4 to AC and to all saving throws, but they inflict only 1 point of piercing damage per attack.</p>

  <p>swallow: the targets' arms grow into wings, allowing them to fly. Unfortunately, they can no longer use their hands.</p>

The exact location of displaced things is obvious, invisibility no longer works and the caster can see into the border of the ursuppe. If the target focuses his vision, he can detect magical auras for a round.</p>
  <p>The target's vision can not penetrate solid objects, not even clothing. It does grant a +4 to alertness and observation.</p>

  <p>This prayer creates a cone of sonic force that deals damage to all creatures within it. It grows more powerful as more people cast it. The cone is 10 meters long and wide (at the end) per caster involved. The casters do not need to be from the same religion. For every person casting the spell, creatures in the area receive 1d4 points of damage. Undead save with a -4 penalty.</p>
  <p>If five or more casters are present, undead are not allowed a saving throw. Also, those who fail to save are deafened for 1d4 rounds.</p>
  <p>If ten or more casters are present, those who fail to save panic and attempt to flee for 2d6 rounds. Also, structures within the area take damage like creatures. Doors, chests, and other breakable items are instantly shattered.</p>
  <p>At the time of casting, the casters must be within 3 meters of each other. The DM may ask the casters to use a single initiative roll. The DC for the saving throw is determined by the caster with the highest priest level.</p>

  <p>Targets are changed along with any items they carry. They retain their identity, and can exist for decades virtually unchanged.</p>
  <p>Damage severe enough to kill the tree kills the target. The original caster can release the targets or a portion of them at will, with a speed of 1, without losing his action for the round.</p>
  <p>This enchantment is a curse.</p>

  <p>This prayer bestows increased spellcasting ability on the caster. It is a cooperative prayer, requiring another priest who must be willing, but not necessarily of the same religion as the caster. At the completion of spellcasting, the caster gains one temporary priest level per three priest levels of the other priest.</p>
  <p>The prayer boosts only the spellcasting ability of the caster. He instantly gains new prayers, even of circles he hasn't himself achieved yet. Range, duration, area and other variables are all based on the caster's temporary level. At the end of the duration, all additional spells are lost and the character reverts to his normal level.</p>
  <p>This prayer causes a severe drain on both the participants. They both lose 1 point from every ability score when the prayer expires.</p>

  <p>The caster can choose to end the spell at any time, causing all the targets to materialize in the physical world. This action has a speed of 3. Targets that occupy a solid object at the end of the prayer are hurled into the depths of the ursuppe.</p>

This action has a speed of 3.</p>
  <p>Breaking through the barrier requires dealing it 50 points of damage. However, the barrier has 12 points of damage reduction to all forms of damage except slashing and fire, to which it has 6 points of damage reduction.</p>

  <p>This prayer conjures a tentacle of water from a body of water at least 2 meters across and 1 meter deep. This tentacle obeys the caster's mental commands within the area of effect. It can be used to make blunt or constricting attacks, but is incapable of fine manipulation. Directing the tentacle requires concentration.</p>
  <p>The tentacle is AC 14 and has 15 hp plus 1 hp per caster level, and is immune to water- or ice-based attacks.</p>
  <p>When used to strike at opponents, it attacks with the caster's base to hit-modifier, adding his [wis]. Its speed is 3. A hit causes 1d6 damage per 3 caster levels. The caster can choose to attack with a -2 penalty and constrict the target, causing normal damage and thereafter causing automatic damage every round until the target escapes the hold. He escapes when a successful hit is made on the tentacle, or when he succeeds at a strength-check with a penalty equal to the caster's [wis].</p>
  <p>The watery fist is immediately released when the caster stops concentrating on it. The water then resumes its normal state.</p>

  <p>The object can be moved on a strength-check with a -10 penalty, with an additional -2 for every extra person touching it. It can be lifted on a check with a -20 penalty, also with a -2 per extra person.</p>
  <p>An affected weapon can be wielded, but it has a -20 penalty to hit. Also, the wielder is helpless between attacks; he has a -10 to AC and is always vulnerable to flanking attacks. If he is actually attacked by more enemies, he can be backstabbed.</p>
