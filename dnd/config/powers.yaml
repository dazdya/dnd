  This power gives the caster a chance to remove a curse from the target. The caster cannot be the target. The DC for the curse is the same as that of the original saving throw, possibly raised by earlier attempts to remove it. If an attempt to cleanse fails, the DC to remove the curse is increased by 2.
  If in doubt, curses can be defined as detrimental spells with a permanent duration.

  This power reaches into the target to read his surface emotions. This grants the caster a +4 bonus to skill-checks and power-checks used against the target for the duration.
  Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the target doesn't know his emotions are being read. If the save is successful, the target cannot be probed again until a day has passed.
Deepsight can be used on standard character races without penalty, but the DM is free to assign any other creatures bonuses to their saving throws.

  This power allows the caster to travel in his dreams. He goes to sleep, starts a dream journey and wakes up in another place. When he wakes, his body and equipment fade away from his starting point.
  The caster must have a destination in mind to use this power. The default distance to travel is one day's journey. Also, he must decide if he wants to bring along any companions and if he wants to go along himself. These factors set the DC for the dream.
starting DC 10
the caster stays behind +1
per extra day of travel +1
per 2 passengers +1
per 4 animal passengers +1
  If the caster fails to reach the DC, he 
wakes up partway to his destination. If he fails to reach 10, he wakes up where he started.
  This power does not interfere with the restful sleep of the passengers. The caster, however, does not regain hit points or ability points when using this power.
  The DM may craft the dream to fit the story, and include obstacles to overcome. The characters' abilities in such situations are probably different from their actual powers, and often highly symbolic.

  This power drains a magical effect and increases the caster's perception. It speeds up the target effect depending on the result of the power check. The power continues until the duration of the target effect is gone or until the caster falls unconscious or goes to sleep.

DC 12 farther away
DC 16 events in the past

  This power allows the caster to detect the presence of supernatural forces in a creature, an area or an object.
  Scanning an area requires a DC of 8. Effects that force a saving throw vs will are easier to detect (-4 to the DC), but the DC is raised by 1 every round after the magic ends. The caster detects all effects that have a lower DC than the result of the power-check.
  Scanning an object requires a DC of 10. A successful scan reveals the presence of any magical powers. A DC of 14 reveals the process of activation of these powers.
  Scanning a creature requires a DC of 12. A successful scan reveals the presence or absence of magical powers. If the target misses his saving throw, the caster learns the origin of the magic, be it wizard spells, priest prayers, warlock powers or other.
  An intelligent object gains a saving throw as if it were a creature, with a +12 bonus to saving throws vs will.

  This power damages an object, within a maximum radius of half a meter. Living tissue is not affected. The caster's chance of success depends on the material he is trying to affect.
cloth DC 4 to tear, DC 10 to ignite or sear
ceramics DC 6 to crack, DC 8 to shatter
wood DC 8 to warp, DC 12 to ignite
leather DC 10 to warp, DC 18 to sear
liquid DC 10 to boil, or ignite flammable
metal DC 14 to warp, DC 18 to break
stone DC 14 to crack, DC 22 to shatter
  Paper is treated as cloth, glass as ceramic, rope as leather, and gems and bone as stone.
  Torn, warped or cracked items are considered improvised, and can possibly be repaired by a craftsman, as ruled by the DM. Ignited, seared, shattered or broken items have become useless. The remains may be useful for other purposes, but the item is considered destroyed.
  Ignited wood is not automatically burnt, especially if the wood is thick. Warped wood cannot be repaired except by magic, but handles and staffs can often be replaced.
  Items often consist of more than one material. Books are bound in leather, doors are reinforced with metal, etc. In these cases, the highest DC is applied, unless the DM rules otherwise.
  If the target object is physically held or worn by a resisting individual, he can attempt a saving throw vs fortitude to negate the effect. Intelligent objects also receive a saving throw.
  Magic items add their bonus to the DC needed. Vellums that hold magic add their highest spell or prayer circle. Other special items also have a better chance to resist this skill. Holy symbols resist automatically.
  A warped weapon has a -2 to hit and is considered improvised. A warped armour is also considered improvised.

  This power seeks to "short" the brain of the target. If the target fails his saving throw, he loses the use of one of his skills. This skill is chosen randomly, so it doesn't have to be a warlock power. Even the use of weapons or languages could be affected, but not class abilities like thieving skills or casting spells.
  The target has a chance to regain his skill every day. Upon waking, he rolls 1d6, and on a 1, he regains the skill. This power can also be negated by powers that remove curses.
  If the target rolls a natural 1 on his saving throw, the effect becomes permanent and is considered a curse.
  For targets without listed skills, the following table can provide ideas. The DM may of course rule that the target has more, less, or different skills than these.
1 the target's native language
2 a profession or food gathering skill
3 a primary weapon skill or attack
4 a basic class skill (as religion or spellcraft)
5 a secondary weapon or class skill or attack
6 a social skill

  This power establishes a telepathic link with a specific target. Through the link, the caster and the target can exchange speech for 3 rounds. The caster also gains a basic idea of the target's situation; is he active or passive, awake or asleep, tired or fresh.
  The target's distance sets the DC. The target can attempt a saving throw vs will to avoid the link.
within 10 m DC   4
within 100 m DC   8

  This power transforms a piece of vellum into a mystical beast that attacks the target and drains his health. The effect is obvious to the caster and the target, but all others see a beast that seems to be made of smoke.
  The paper tiger attacks the target with a single attack every round. Its speed is 2 and its bonus to hit is equal to the warlock level of the caster. Its AC is equal to the target's character level + 20, but the caster and the target have a +10 bonus to attack it. It has 1 hit point and takes no damage from area effects.
  If the beast hits, its damage depends on the result of the power check.

  This power jolts the target's mind like shocking news. In his mind, he is reduced to a certain number of hit points, depending on the power-check of the caster. He will pass out when the remaining hit points are gone, but he won't bleed to death. The effect wears off after one hour.
  It is possible to gain hit points through the use of this power. In this case, the target stays conscious as long as he believes he has hit points, but he may suddenly lose health after the duration. The mind is a strange thing.

  This power allows the caster to influence the target mentally. He can distract the target, or make a suggestion sound reasonable. This power does not make the suggestion; it makes him more susceptible to what the caster says.
  A distraction requires a somatic component. It grants a +4 bonus to skill-checks against the target. This applies to all skill-checks, not just those made by the caster.
  A suggestion requires a verbal component, and the ability to communicate with the target. If the saving throw is failed, the suggestion sounds completely reasonable to the target. The DM is free to assign a modifier to the suggestion, or to rule out one that is completely unnatural to the target. If the save is failed, the target won't realise later that what he did was unreasonable. It can last for a maximum of one hour.

  This power allows the caster to move objects from a distance. Living creatures are not objects, although objects can carry creatures. The weight of the object sets the DC. If more people are contesting control over an object, the highest power-check gains control. A creature holding an object gains a saving throw vs fortitude to hold on to it. Intelligent objects gain a saving throw vs will to resist.
up to 5 kg DC 10 1d6 damage
5-50 kg DC 15 2d6 damage
50-500 kg DC 20 4d6 damage
500-5,000 kg DC 25 6d6 damage
over 5,000 kg DC 30 8d6 damage
  If the caster wants to attack with an object, the power-check counts as an attack roll. The amount of damage is determined by that result, which must be high enough to move the object. An object that is attached or bolted down, is treated as if it is one category heavier.
  When moving multiple objects, the base DC is set by the heaviest object, and each additional object adds a +2 to the DC. When doing this, the caster cannot attack with any of the objects.
