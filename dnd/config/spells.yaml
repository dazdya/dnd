  <p>This spell imbues a dead body with magic so as to transform it into a duplicate of the caster. This duplicate has the same exact abilities as the caster, and follows its orders. However, every time the clone wakes up within a kilometer of the caster, it must save vs will (DC 15) or be overcome with the desire to dispose of the caster and take his place.</p>
  <p>This disadvantage can be negated by enchanting a living body instead of a dead one. This body must be conscious during the casting. It gets a saving throw vs fortitude to resist the physical transformation (which changes ability scores, class abilities and hit points). It also gets a saving throw vs will to maintain his skills and identity (the rest). Even if both these saves are failed, the clone still has a permanent -2 on all attack-rolls and skill- and ability-checks.</p>
  <p>In addition to the generic components, this spell requires a body.</p>

  <p>The standard effect of the glyph is an explosion that inflicts 3d4 heat damage. The explosion affects everything in a 3 meter radius. A successful save vs reflex halves the damage.</p>

  <p>A third-circle caster also slows his targets, halving their movement, delaying their actions (+2 initiative) and inflicting a -2 to hit and a -2 to skill- and ability-checks. This effect lasts until the spell ends, even if the targets leave the area.</p>
  <p>A fourth-circle caster can influence a target's actions, giving him orders which he follows as long as the caster is concentrating and the target stays inside the area. This does not require the targets to understand the caster's language; the control is mental. If the orders are obviously suicidal, the spell ends.</p>
  <p>A fifth-circle caster can give orders that the target will follow until the spell ends without requiring the caster's concentration.</p>
  <p>A sixth-circle caster can give orders to all targets in the spell simultaneously.</p>

  <p>This spell enchants an object so that it can fly as fast as a galloping horse. The caster can control the flight by concentration, using either the meditation or the spellcraft skill. If he does not, the item continues on its course and speed.</p>
  <p>The type of object the spell can affect is determined by the circle the caster has achieved. A fourth-circle caster can enchant a broom, a fifth-circle caster also a shield, and a sixth-circle caster also a carpet.</p>
  <p>A broom can also be a spear or staff. It can carry up to two people, one of which is the caster. It has a handling and speed modifier of -5. If a rider takes damage, fails a saving throw or fails to hold on with both hands, he must make a tumbling-check every round or fall. The caster may roll this as a group-check.</p>
  <p>A shield can carry the caster. It has a handling modifier equal to the caster's highest circle, and a speed modifier of -10. The caster can instinctively keep his balance on the shield, but if he fails a saving throw, he must make a tumbling-check or fall off.</p>
  <p>A carpet can also be a table, a couch or any object of the same general size. It can hold several people, its limitation being room not weight. It has a handling modifier of -10 and a speed modifier equal to the caster's highest circle. If a rider falls on or below 0 hit points, he must save vs reflex (DC 10) or fall off.</p>

  <p>This spell allows the caster to create minor effects when concentrating. He can fetch coins from ears and rabbits from hats, sweep the floor and dry or brush off clothes. These effects cannot inflict damage or force a saving throw, and they are obviously magical.</p>
  <p>A 2nd-circle caster can discharge this spell to repair things. A shattered vase, punctured waterskin or snapped leather strap, when put together, fuses again and is as good as new. A skill-check may be needed to ensure that the item is repaired correctly.</p>
  <p>A 3rd-circle caster can discharge this spell to create nonmagical items out of thin air. These items are of improvised quality unless the caster has the skill to create them normally. Creating very specific items, such as keys, grants the caster an applicable skill-check with a -4 penalty to succeed.</p>
  <p>A 4th-circle caster can discharge this spell to harden an object no larger than a brick, making it as strong as steel and giving it a damage reduction of 10 to all attacks.</p>
  <p>A 5th-circle caster can repair and fabricate items without discharging the spell.</p>
  <p>A 6th-circle caster can harden items without discharging the spell.</p>

  <p>This spell inflicts the target with a disability chosen by the caster at the time of casting, but limited by the circle he has achieved.</p>
  <p>A 2nd-circle caster can make the target deaf or itching. A deaf target cannot hear, and an itching target faces a -2 to all ability-, skill- and power-checks, saving throws and to hit.</p>
  <p>A 3rd-circle caster can make the target blind or mute. A blind target faces a -4 penalty to hit and to AC. Creatures with more heads may be less crippled. A mute target cannot speak or use magic with verbal components.</p>
  <p>A 4th-circle caster can slow the target. A slowed target has only half his movement speed, and can take an action only every second round. He also loses his [str] to attack- and damage-rolls, and his [dex] to AC.</p>
  <p>If the caster chooses an effect at least two circles below his abilities, he can try to make the effect permanent. If he does this, the target gains a saving throw versus fortitude to negate the entire effect. As soon as this permanent effect has taken hold, it is treated as a curse.</p>

  <p>This spell binds one small creature of animal intelligence to the caster. The minion becomes an extension of the caster, and is infused with some of his magic.</p>
  <p>The caster gains a +1 to saving throws and AC when the minion is within 10 meters. If it's in this range, its presence also grants him a +1 to alertness- and observation-checks for every circle he has achieved.</p>
  <p>The caster can see and hear through the senses of the minion. It takes him one round to switch his senses to his minion's. Switching back is instantaneous, but the caster still needs a moment to regain his bearings; on the round he switches back, his initiative is delayed by 3.</p>
  <p>A fourth-circle caster gains the ability to speak through his minion. He can then also speak the language of his minion, and thus communicate with animals of its species.</p>
  <p>A fifth-circle caster gains the ability to cast his spells through his familiar. The minion must produce the necessary material and somatic components for this.</p>
  <p>The minion has 5 hit points and an AC of 15. It has the same bonus to hit as the caster, but it does only 1 point of slashing damage on a hit. Its attack speed is 3.</p>
  <p>The caster can choose to sacrifice his minion in a magical attack. This action has a speed of 3. If he succeeds on an attack vs AC 10, the caster cannot use any more magic until he has had a full night's rest. The target must save vs will or suffer the same. This attack counts as an action for the caster as well as his minion.</p>
  <p>Any animal no smaller than a frog or a mouse can serve as a minion. However, some can serve better, either because they can fly or swim or because they can produce the somatic components for spellcasting.</p>
  <p>If the minion is fed its normal food, then it retains its natural appearance. If only the magic sustains it, then it will eventually shrivel away to a skeletal form.</p>
  <p>The caster can also create an artificial creature for this spell. Such a creature is usually called a homunculus and its appearance is decided by the caster. Creating it requires one week, one annum of supplies and an itemcraft-check. A failed check ruins the materials, but a successful check changes the duration of the spell from sustainable to permanent.</p>

  <p>This spell plodes the terrain. The change is obvious to anyone. Creatures in the area must roll a saving throw just before their own action, or during if they are moving through the area. A creature can try to avoid a saving throw when moving through the area (not if already in it) by attempting a tumbling-check with a penalty equal to the caster's wizard level.</p>
  <p>A first-circle caster can choose to implode the area. Everything in the area gets stuck and harder to move around. Affected creatures lose 2 points of dexterity for every circle the caster has achieved.</p>
  <p>A second-circle caster can choose to explode the area. Everything in the area starts sparking when there is friction with other matter. Affected creatures take 1d4 lightning damage for every circle the caster has achieved.</p>

  <p>A fifth-circle caster can choose to replode the area. Everything in the area takes itself apart and puts itself together again. Affected creatures must roll to see if they still have their equipment. The chance is 50%, and is rolled for every item.</p>

  <p>This spell does not take up space, it can attack from almost within another creature. It cannot be damaged, but if an attack against the shadow hits AC 25, then the caster loses 1d3 points of strength.</p>
  <p>The spell requires the caster to have a shadow. Shadowboxing attacks have a -4 to hit in an area of magical illumination.</p>

  <p>This spell illuminates the tip of the caster's staff with a bright white light. The caster must hold the staff, if he drops it the spell ends.</p>
  <p>A 2nd-circle caster can change the intensity of the light. This requires a round of concentration equivalent to spellcasting.</p>
  <p>A 3rd-circle caster can change the colour of the light just like the intensity.</p>
  <p>The caster can discharge the spell in an attempt to blind a target within short range for 1 turn. This is an action with a speed of 3 that is equivalent to spellcasting.</p>
  <p>This spell requires the caster to wield a staff or club, but it does not interfere with the somatic components for his spells as a normal staff would. It does not require him to be trained in the use of maces.</p>

  <p>This spell sucks out the identity of the target and places it inside a gem. The target's body collapses into nothingness, leaving his possessions. The caster also sets a password.</p>
  <p>The gem functions as if it is a different plane of existence. The occupant exists in an endless fog without any substance, naked and cold, without needing to eat, drink or sleep. He does not age. He is alone.</p>
  <p>A person holding the gem can communicate with the occupant, sounding like a booming voice in the gem, and hearing a little voice in his mind. He can also release the occupant, an action that takes one round and the password.</p>
  <p>The gem's magic can be dispelled, but that kills the occupant. The occupant can be scried normally. A lockpicking-check with a -20 penalty can open the gem, if the person trying that can detect magic. It is possible to use plane-travelling magic to enter the gem, a process requiring a successful planar theory-check. However, the gem's magic is such that the travellers arrive without possessions, like the occupant. A caster attempting the journey will realize this and may roll a save vs reflex (DC 15) to abort the journey before it is too late.</p>
  <p>The focus is a specially prepared gem, worth at least 1 annum. The gem can hold only one target. If it is used again, or if another creature enters the gem, its occupant is released.</p>

  <p>This spell attempt to turn magic used against the target back on its caster. It has no effect on area attacks that include the target, or on magic that functions through touch.</p>
  <p>The effect of the spell depends on the kind of magic being used.</p>
  <p>If the target must save vs fortitude, then a successful save reflects the attack back on the caster, while a failed save has its normal effect.</p>
  <p>If the target must save vs reflex, then a successful save reflects the attack back on the caster, while a failed save merely deflects it onto any creature nearby unlucky enough to roll a 1 on a d20. This new target (or targets) must then save vs the original spell.</p>
  <p>If the target must save vs will, then he gains a +4 bonus from this spell, but the magic does not reflect.</p>
  <p>If there is no defense against the attack, then the caster is allowed a saving throw vs fortitude (DC 20) to dissipate the magic harmlessly.</p>

  <p>This spell allows the caster to see magic that is in effect in close range. If magic is detected from either a spell, prayer or warlock power, the caster can try to learn more about it. This takes one round, and requires a spellcraft-check. On a successful check, he learns the strength of the magic compared to his own caster level (stronger, comparable or weaker). He can make an observation-check to see the remnants of past magic, with a -2 penalty for every turn that has passed.</p>
  <p>The caster can detect more magic depending on the circle he has achieved.</p>
  <p>A 2nd-circle caster can discharge this spell to examine the magic on an item. This takes one turn. He then rolls a spellcraft-check and loses 2 points of intelligence. On a successful check, he learns more of the item, depending on the DM's wisdom.</p>
  <p>A 3rd-circle caster can discharge this spell to examine a person. This takes one round. He learns if the target is capable of using magic. If the target fails a saving throw vs will, the caster learns the type(s) of magic.</p>
  <p>A 4th-circle caster using this spell can try to determine if he is being magically watched. This takes one round. He then rolls a saving throw vs will. If the result of that roll is equal to or higher than 10 + circle + caster's [int] of any observer, the caster detects the scrying magic.</p>
  <p>A 5th-circle caster can attempt to examine items and casters without discharging the spell.</p>
  <p>A 6th-circle caster can detect more than you could ever imagine.</p>
  <p>This spell never detects any form of invisibility magic or magic that enhances stealth.</p>

  <p>This spell transforms the target into a stone statue. If he makes his saving throw, then he gains the ability to switch back and forth between his normal form and a stone aspect.</p>
  <p>As a statue, standing still comes naturally. Also, the target cannot move. It takes an observation-check with a -10 penalty or an opposed artistic ability-check to determine that something is wrong with the statue. Its nature is undetectable with magic that detects magic.</p>
  <p>Changing back and forth between stone and flesh takes 1 round. Even in his normal form, the target retains the advantages of the spell, as well as a slightly rocky appearance, obvious on a successful observation-check.</p>
  <p>The target gains 10 points of damage reduction against all forms of damage. He is immune to bleeding. His strength score is raised by 1 point or to 16, whichever is higher. His AC is raised by 5 points.</p>
  <p>However, he is also slowed. His movement is halved, and he cannot jump or tumble. He is also as heavy as, well, a statue.</p>

  <p>This spell creates a space where there is none. The new space is shaped like a demi-sphere, a circular flat floor with a dome. Its borders are cold, dark and impenetrable, and its surface has a radius of 1 meter for every circle the caster has achieved. The entrance is shaped like a doorway.</p>
  <p>The tardis is invisible to the naked eye, but it is possible to enter it accidentally. To do this, someone needs only to cross the entrance from the right direction. If he grazes it, he feels goosebumps. To a person detecting magic, these goosebumps are visible as a magic effect. The caster can detect the location of the spell even without detecting magic, by rolling an alertness-check.</p>
  <p>Creatures inside the tardis don't notice anything outside the spell, and creatures outside cannot see in. It should be noticed, however, that some things, such as smoke from a fire or spilled liquid, can exit the spell.</p>

  <p>A second-circle caster can choose to make a zeta of cold, inflicting 1d4 cold damage per round. If the target leaves the zeta, his class bonus to attack rolls is halved until he rests for half an hour.</p>
  <p>A third-circle caster can choose to make a zeta of fire, inflicting 1d4 fire damage per round. If the target leaves the zeta, he can only cast the lowest effect of his spells, without any reserve effects, until he rests for half an hour.</p>
  <p>A fourth-circle caster can choose to make a zeta of thunder, inflicting 1d4 sonic damage per round. If the target leaves the zeta, he can no longer cast prayers of the highest circle he has attained until he rests for half an hour.</p>
  <p>A fifth-circle caster can choose to make a zeta of lightning, inflicting 1d4 lightning damage per round. If the target leaves the zeta, the bonuses he gets from his skill points are halved until he rests for half an hour.</p>

  <p>The spell surrounds only one target. If the target actively carries or supports another creature, it may be possible to catch two targets; otherwise, the mechanics of dodging ensure a single target.</p>
